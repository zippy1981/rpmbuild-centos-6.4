= Introduction =
RPM sources taken from Fedora Core SRPMs built atains Centos 6.4 with ROMFORGE additions.

= Background =
I created a fresh CentOS 6.4 install, added the rpmforge uyum repo, did a yum update, and then attepted to buold mono from the git head. Many of the CentOS libraries were too old to do this successfully. To work around this I build several Fedora Core 16-19 and RawHide RPMs. I will eventually add the Mono RPMs here as well.
